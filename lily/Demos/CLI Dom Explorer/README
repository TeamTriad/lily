HOWTO

* Start the dom explorer by opening the file cli-dom-explorer.json.

* Open a terminal window and telnet to port 8888 on localhost ("telnet localhost 8888"). After connecting to the patch you'll be at the root level of whatever HTML document is loaded.

* Supported commands are "ls", "pwd", "cd" and "rm" with some limitations:

** ls only lists the current directory. any arguments are ignored.
** cd & rm only work one level deep. (i.e. only only on objects in the current directory) cd also supports the arguments "/" & ".."

* Doesn't work on windows.
