HOWTO

* Start the demo by opening the file html-dom-visualizer.json.

* Clicking the message boxes at the top ("dom_parser1.sketch", etc) executes that particular visualization script on whatever HTML document is currently loaded in the browser window.

* Performance varies depending on the HTML doc & sketch. Sketch 4 in particular is slow with whatever document is used.
